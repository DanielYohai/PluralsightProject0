# Project Tasks
<br />The tasks for this project are as follows:

After installing `pytest`, check that the library has been properly installed by confirming the version:

`py.test --version`

`This is pytest version 5.4.1, imported from c:\python380\lib\site-packages\pytest\__init__.py`

## Task 2 - Get User Input
