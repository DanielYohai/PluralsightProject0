# Project Tasks
<br />The tasks for this project are as follows:

## Task 0 - Install `pytest`

Pytest is not part of the Python Standard Library.  For this project's unit testing, it will be necessary to install third-party `pytest` library on your local development platform:

https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/getting-started.html

After installing `pytest`, check that the library has been properly installed by confirming the version with either of the following commands:

`py.test --version`

`pytest --version`

Both commands should return output that is similar to the following, but will vary according to your specific local development environment:

`This is pytest version 5.4.1, imported from c:\python380\lib\site-packages\pytest\__init__.py`

If you do not see a message similar to the one above, then `pytest` wasn't installed properly, and you will need to troubleshoot and solve this issue before you can proceed with the Projects Tasks.

## Task 1 - Get User Input

You will be prompted to enter three (3) integer numbers.  

Each user-inputted number will be tested using `pytest` and confirmed as either a "Tesla Number" (i.e. a number that is divisible by 3), or not a Tesla Number.

Additional tests will be performed to corroborrate the findings of the first test.  

## Task 2 -
