# Project 0 Tasks
<br />The tasks for this Project 0 are as follows:

## Task 0 - Install `pytest`

Pytest is not part of the Python Standard Library.  For this project's unit testing, it will be necessary to install third-party `pytest` library on your local development platform:

https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/getting-started.html

After installing `pytest`, check that the library has been properly installed by confirming the version with either of the following commands:

`py.test --version`

`pytest --version`

Both commands should return output that is similar to the following, but will vary according to your specific local development environment:

`This is pytest version 5.4.1, imported from c:\python380\lib\site-packages\pytest\__init__.py`

If you do not see a message similar to the one above, then `pytest` wasn't installed properly, and you will need to troubleshoot and solve this issue before you can proceed with the Projects Tasks.

## Task 1 - Get User Input

Run the main program by typing `python main.py` in your command window from the root directory where you place the files for this project.

You will be prompted to enter three (3) random integer numbers of your choice.

Each user-inputted number will be tested using `pytest` and confirmed as either a "Tesla Number" (i.e. a number that is divisible by 3), or not a Tesla Number.

Additional tests will be performed to corroborate the findings of the first test.
