# Project Overview

This project will guide you step by step to test if user input data are valid "Tesla Numbers", i.e. numbers divisible by 3, e.g. 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, etc.

In order to make the project as simple as possible to understand the essential testing concepts, we will be using the third-party `pytest` testing library since it requires less boilerplate code than the built-in `unittest` that comes as part of the Python Standard Library. 

# Background
### "If you only knew the magnificence of the 3, 6, and 9, then you would have a key to the universe." - Nikola Tesla

Nikola Tesla was a deep and mysterious man. He sought and discovered hidden laws, facts, and truths of the Universe, and shared them with mankind. As you will come to know, Mathematics is something that is discovered (not invented), Mathematics is the language of the Universe, and Mathematics never lies.  


Nikola Tesla is reputed to have been fascinated unto the point of obsession with the numbers 3, 6, and 9. Indeed, these 3 numbers have special qualities and properties when compared to the other digits in our number system. Watch the video below for a quick introduction.
